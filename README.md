### What is Sanchara?

- Sanchara is an ambitious project to create a **peer-to-peer, decentralized traffic reporting system** that empowers communities to share real-time traffic information without relying on centralized platforms or compromising privacy.

- *San-Chara* draws its name from the community: San for goodness, Chara for movement, and Sanchara for togetherness (Inspired and suggested by [Raghav](https://github.com/raghavyuva) )

### Core Vision

- **Our vision**: A crowdsourced traffic map where users can report jams, accidents, hazards, and clear roadsâ€”all while maintaining complete data ownership and privacy.

- Checkout our Public Roadmap [here](https://github.com/shravan20/sanchara/discussions/2).

### Current Status: Foundation Phase

- Right now, we've a **waiting list page** for early adopters and contributors to sign up. This is just the beginning!

- **Current Phase:** Join our waiting list at [sanchara.waitlist](https://shravan20.github.io/sanchara/).

### Current Implementation

- This is a simple waiting list page as of now.

### How We Work (Community Promise)

- **100% transparency** - All code, data, and decisions are public
- **Community-driven** - Roadmap and priorities shaped by community input
- **Every bit counts** - All contributions matters
- **Open collaboration** - Join via PR, [Discord](https://discord.gg/VYE9CNtcp5), or just follow along!
